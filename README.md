## Spellbinding Weaver

This Raycast extension utilizes the OpenAI ChatGPT language model to generate human-like text based on user input. The extension allows users to send prompts to the ChatGPT model and receive a response. The response is automatically copied to the clipboard, allowing users to easily paste it into other applications.



### Overview
The Spellbinding Weaver provides a seamless integration of the OpenAI ChatGPT language model into the Raycast environment. Users can quickly receive context-aware text completions for their prompts and use the generated text in other applications.

### Features
- Send prompts to the ChatGPT model
- Customize the model, temperature, max tokens, top-p, frequency penalty, and presence penalty
- Automatically copy the generated text to the clipboard
- Instantly paste the response in other applications
- Extension preferences to modify settings

### Installation
1. Install Raycast
2. Clone or download the repository
3. Go to folder, `npm i && npm run dev` 
4. Open raycast, find "Write Command"
3. Configure your OpenAI API key, model, and other preferences in the extension settings

### Usage

2. Type your prompt in the search bar
3. Press Enter or click "Do the magic" to send the prompt to the ChatGPT model
4. Wait for the completion toast to appear, indicating that the response has been received
5. The generated text will be automatically copied to your clipboard
6. Paste the response into the desired application

### Customization
You can customize the extension's behavior by opening the Extension Preferences in Raycast. Here, you can modify the following settings:

- OpenAI API key: Your OpenAI API key is required to interact with the ChatGPT language model. Make sure to provide a valid key.

- Model: Choose the ChatGPT model you want to use for generating text completions. Different models may provide varying levels of creativity and relevance.
- Temperature: Adjust the temperature value to influence the randomness of the generated text. Higher values will produce more diverse and creative responses, while lower values will result in more focused and deterministic completions.
- Max Tokens: Set the maximum number of tokens (words or word pieces) to be generated in the response. This allows you to control the length of the text completion.
- Top-P: Define the top probability value to sample the tokens from. A higher value will consider a larger set of tokens, leading to more diverse responses, while a lower value will focus on the most likely tokens.
- Frequency Penalty: Adjust the frequency penalty to control the repetition of words in the generated text. A higher penalty will discourage repetitive phrases, whereas a lower penalty may allow for more repetition.
- Presence Penalty: Modify the presence penalty to influence the model's behavior when generating text that has already been mentioned in the prompt. A higher penalty will discourage the use of prompt content, while a lower penalty may allow for more similar content.
